*(Diagram: API Gateway → Audit Service, Fraud Service, Energy Service, Dashboard Service → PostgreSQL + S3 + Message Queue)*  

- **Components:**  
  - **API Gateway:** Auth & routing.  
  - **Audit Engine:** Slither + custom ML.  
  - **Fraud Monitor:** Stream processor ingesting chain events.  
  - **Energy Analyzer:** Batch + real-time CO₂ estimations.  
  - **Dashboard/API:** Aggregates data for UI & reporting.  
  - **Data Store:** PostgreSQL for metadata; S3 for reports.  
- **Data Flows:**  
  1. User uploads or enters address → API → Audit Service → queue.  
  2. Audit Service fetches code → runs Slither + ML → stores results.  
  3. Fraud Service subscribes to chain events → anomaly algorithm → push alerts.  
  4. Energy Service fetches gas/energy APIs → computes metrics.  
  5. Dashboard queries consolidated DB.  

## 3.2 Technical Specifications  
- **Database Schema:**  
  - **contracts** (id, address, chain, upload_ts, status)  
  - **audits** (id, contract_id, severity_counts JSON, report_url)  
  - **alerts** (id, type, entity, risk_score, timestamp)  
  - **energy_reports** (id, contract_id, co2_estimate, recommendation)  
- **API Definitions:**  
  - `POST /audit` → { contractFile or address } → { jobId }  
  - `GET /audit/{jobId}` → status + results  
  - `GET /alerts?address=` → list of alerts  
- **Security Protocols:**  
  - JWT + wallet challenge for user identity.  
  - TLS 1.3 everywhere.  
- **Performance:**  
  - Caching layer (Redis) for repeated chain queries.  

## 3.3 User Experience Design  
- **User Journeys:**  
  - **Developer Flow:** Upload contract → review detailed vulnerability map → download PDF → integrate fix.  
  - **Trader Flow:** Paste address → see “Green/Yellow/Red” summary → expand plain-English explanations.  
- **Wireframes:**  
  1. **Landing → Scan** (upload/dropzone + address field).  
  2. **Scan Progress** (progress bar + cancel).  
  3. **Results Page** (risk badges, top 5 issues, energy comparison).  
  4. **Dashboard** (history, alerts table, export button).  
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation; high-contrast mode.  
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Fluid layout; collapsible panels.  
- **Training & Docs:** Inline “What this means” tooltips; dedicated “Learn” section.

# SECTION 4: IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

## 4.1 Development Methodology  
- **Approach:** Agile Scrum, 2-week sprints.  
- **Ceremonies:** Sprint planning, daily standups, sprint review, retro.  
- **QA & Testing:** Unit tests (pytest, Jest), integration tests (Postman), security scans (OWASP).  
- **Code Review:** Pull request mandatory reviews, branch protection.  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions → build → tests → security scan → deploy to staging.  

### Robust Report Naming & Slither Integration  
- Each audit job generates a unique report file (e.g. `<job_id>-report.json`) to prevent file collisions in shared environments and support parallel analysis.
- The pipeline avoids obsolete Slither CLI flags (`--overwrite-json`, `--config-json`) for compatibility with Slither ≥0.11.3 and future versions.
- Future-proof: Detect Slither version at runtime and adapt arguments as needed (e.g., warn if version <0.11.3 or missing features).
